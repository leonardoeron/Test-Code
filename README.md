# ArcTouch /Code Challenge

This is a test banner for the Code Challenge.

## Technologies

I always prefer to create simple solutions to the problems and focus on UI Design. This banner use GSAP library [TweenMax], HTML and CSS.


[TweenMax - GSAP](https://greensock.com/) por Greensock.


## Improvements

I could work with B.E.M. (block element modifier) to improve how the appearance of css should appear in the code, but as many developers say: "do not to use B.E.M. The CSS gets weird", I left the CSS by default.

## Running

Just open the index.html on a device with internet connection because the script is from external link.
