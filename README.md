# ArcTouch /Code Challenge

This is a test banner for the Code Challenge.

## Technologies

I always prefer to create simple solutions to the problems and focus on UI Design, not overengineering the things. This banner use GSAP library, HTML5 and CSS.

## Improvements

I could work with B.E.M. (block element modifier).

## Running

Just open the index.html on a device with internet connection because the script is from external link.
